## Checklist
- [ ] I used repo scripts for build/run (`scripts/build.ps1`, `scripts/run.ps1`)
- [ ] This change is pushed to GitHub for review (PRs + direct pushes to `master`)
- [ ] `.gitignore` is updated for any new non-repo artifacts (e.g., `temp/`, logs, generated outputs)
- [ ] No local artifacts are tracked (e.g., `temp/` or `logs/`), except `logs/.gitkeep`
- [ ] I updated docs (`docs/`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `TODO.md`) if needed
